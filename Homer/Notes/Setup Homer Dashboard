Setting up Homer Dashboard Instructions

Note: I had issues with the docker container not containing everything (New to docker, so might of been my issues) and I wanted to set up some instructions for future setups. Will be an Ansible book in the future.

Using the bastienwirtz's Homer repo:
  1. Under "Using the release tarball (prebuilt, ready to use) repo here: https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started
    a. wget the url listed
    b. unzip the file in the assets folder. DO NOT UNZIP OUTSIDE THAT FOLDER OR YOU WILL HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP!
    c. cp the config.yml.dist like shown and this will give you the default template.
    d. You can skip step c. if you'd like (Untested as of 4th of April, 2024) and just sudo touch config.yml and load the config.yml listed under files/config.yml

Pulling down icons for Homer dashboard
  1. NX211 has a repo of all the PNG images you will need. Repo can be found here: https://github.com/NX211/homer-icons
    a. Pull down whatever is needed. Ex: Pi-hole, Plex, Jellyfin, etc.
